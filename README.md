# Recyclemania-

Recyclemania has one goal: to teach people about recycling.

We built a game that teaches people about recycling, specifically teaching them the difference between recyclable materials and nonrecyclable materials.

The user will be prompted with multiple choice questions (there are 9, which will appear in a random order). The user must try to choose the correct answer(s) to each question. If they get a question wrong, they will be prompted why. Regardless of if they get it right or not, they will move on to the next question. They will then try to choose the correct answer(s). Then, they will move on to the next question. This pattern then continues.

Note: the user will be prompted with a fun fact after they answer a question. These can act like 'hints' and can help the user answer upcoming questions. These also help the user learn about recycling.
