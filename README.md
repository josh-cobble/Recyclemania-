# Recyclemania-

Recyclemania has one goal: to teach people about recycling.

We are trying to build a game that teaches people about recycling; specifically teaching them the difference between recyclable materials and nonrecyclable materials. The user will have to guess if each material is recyclable or not, and then we will tell them if they are correct.
