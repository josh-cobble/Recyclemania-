In order to access the questions you must make instances of the classes where they were declared like below:

TestsRecycling.SimpleQuestions simpleQuestions = new TestsRecycling().new SimpleQuestions();
TestsRecycling.ComplexQuestions complexQuestions = new TestsRecycling().new ComplexQuestions();

Then use the array iself:
simpleQuestions.questions[10]

the Question class has methods you'll need:
the GetQuestion() method returns a string and allows you to get the question stored in the class

the getAnswers() method returns all the possible answers of the question as an array of strings

the checkAnswer() method allows you to see if the question is correct by entering the selected 
answer as a string and using that as a key to a treeMap to get the boolean value, which it returns
